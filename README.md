Step 1: Go to the repo and select Download Zip.

Step 2: Unzip the zip file with your unarchiver of choice into a folder of the same name. This can be in a “temp” directory or anywhere else. In these instructions, I have placed the folder in “Downloads”.

Step 3: The resulting directory structure looks like this:

Step 4: Open the project in Android Studio, selecting the unzipped folder.

Step 5: Edit local.properties to point to the Android SDK on your computer. Here is an example of what Mac OS looks like:

sdk.dir=/Users/sambartleman/Library/Android/sdk/

On Windows this might look like:

sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\brans\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk

Step 6: You should now be able to set the build target to “app” and select the target you wish, either an emulator or local device. Clicking the green run button in Android Studio will launch the app. (Note you may also need to sync gradle in order to build dependencies.)
